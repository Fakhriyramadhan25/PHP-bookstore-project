    Insider: how to create a bookshop?
     <br>
    </h1>
   


    <h5 class="title">We're talking about creation a book.</h5>
    <p class="content"> For many people, writing a book is a lifelong dream. Indeed, as we reveal in our publishing podcast Bestseller, roughly 80% of Americans have wanted to write and publish a book at some point — but fewer than 0.1% have actually done it.

<br>
So what’s the secret formula that will unlock your creativity and show you how to write a book that will make your dreams come true? Some authors would tell you that there is no single path to authorship, as every writer’s journey is unique.
<br>
We’d counter with this: almost every bestselling author will have highly effective writing patterns and habits that help them reach their goals. If you want to write a book of your very own, all you have to do is emulate them!

So let's get started. Here's a step-by-step process on how to write a book:<br><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li> Find your “big book idea”</li>
<li> Research your genre</li>
<li> Outline the story</li>
<li> Nail the opening sentence</li>
<li> Write the first draft</li>
<li> Keep your readers in mind</li>
<li> Set word count goals</li>
<li> Schedule out a writing routine</li>
<li> Create a writing space</li>
<li> Work with book writing software</li>
<li> Avoid distractions </li>
<li> Trust in the writing process</li>
<li> Finish the first draft</li>
<li> Edit and revise your manuscript </li>
<li> Publish your book</li>
</ol><br><br>
